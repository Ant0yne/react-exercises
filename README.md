# React Exercises

This is a selection of my React exercises I made as part of my training to become a web and mobile developer with the school "Le Reacteur"

## To know

Not all the exercises are design and have layout. This is just a time issue. My first goal was to learn and practice React basics :

- init a project
- components
- components structure
- assets in React
- props
- conditions
- destructuring
- .map() in React
- States
- event on React
- forms
- ...
